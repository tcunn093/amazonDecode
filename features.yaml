Points:
    - Echo uses Alexa Voice Services to serve requests
    - We serve information to the user from EventBrite, and NewsAPI.org

Example_Explanation:
    - We can search for events from EventBrite using Location, Date, and Keyword, and any permutation of those provided.
    - We can search for news headlines from NewsAPI.org
    - We say "Ask deCODE" as a trigger because it has multiple functions

Ask_deCODE:
    - What's happening tonight?
        - Echo, Ask Decode, Whats happening tonight?
    - What's happening in Toronto on October 21st?
        - Echo, Ask Decode, Whats happening in Toroonto on October 21st?
    - What's happening today?
        - Echo, Ask Decode, Whats happening today?
    - What's happening wednesday night?
        - Echom Ask Decode, Whats happening wednesday night?
    - What's in the news?
        - Echo, Ask Decode, What's in the news?

Reflections:
    - Sessions are used for keeping track of information in a conversation.
    - In our case, we had trouble near the end saving them properly, but ideally, they we would be able to ask more info on them later in the conversation.
