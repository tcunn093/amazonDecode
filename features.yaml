Points:
    - Echo uses Alexa Voice Services to serve request in the clouds
    - We serve information to the user from EventBrite, and NewsAPI.org
	- We used the Alexa Skills API to develop a new skill that we called deCODE

What_We_Did:
	- AVS converts speech input into text. It also has built in parsing of Dates, Locations, and Times that we used.
		- For example, saying 'Five' will be transformed into the number 5 in the data that our skill is passed.
	- We use sessions to keep track of the conversation, for asking complex, or multi step questions.
		- For example, more info.
	- We used Node.js as a runtime in the cloud

Example_Explanation:
    - We can search for events from EventBrite using Location, Date, and Keyword, and any permutation of those provided.
    - We can search for news headlines from NewsAPI.org
    - We say "Ask deCODE" as a trigger because it has multiple functions

Ask_deCODE:
    - What's happening tonight?
        - Echo, Ask Decode, Whats happening tonight?
    - Whats happening about music?
		- Echom Ask Decode, Whats happening about music?
	- What's happening in Toronto on October 21st?
        - Echo, Ask Decode, Whats happening in Toroonto on October 21st?
    - What's happening today?
        - Echo, Ask Decode, Whats happening today?
    - What's happening wednesday night?
        - Echom Ask Decode, Whats happening wednesday night?
    - What's in the news?
        - Echo, Ask Decode, What's in the news?

Reflections:
	- We did this without a developer for most of the time.
	- We worked together as a team well to accomplish a task.
	- We debugged together well.
	- None of us really had any good Node.js experience, and we managed to make it work.
